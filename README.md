## Supported Wallets

- **Rainbow Wallet** - Primary support with optimized UX
- **MetaMask** - Full compatibility
- **Other Ethereum Wallets** - Any wallet that supports the standard Ethereum provider API

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

- **React** (^18.2.0) - UI framework
- **ethers** (^6.15.0) - Ethereum library for wallet interactions
- **react-scripts** (5.0.1) - Build tools and development server

### Architecture

The application uses the Ethereum provider API (`window.ethereum`) to:
- Detect installed wallets
- Request account access
- Retrieve wallet addresses
- Fetch account balances
- Handle connection state

### Key Components

- `App.js` - Main component with wallet connection logic
- `checkConnection()` - Automatically detects existing connections
- `connectWallet()` - Initiates new wallet connections
- `updateBalance()` - Fetches and displays ETH balance
- `disconnectWallet()` - Clears connection state

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App

### Code Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.js          # Main application component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.css         # Application styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js        # Application entry point
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css       # Global styles
```

## Security Considerations

- Never store private keys in the application
- Always validate user inputs
- Use secure RPC endpoints for production
- Implement proper error handling for wallet interactions

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Chromium-based browsers (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari (with wallet extension support)
- Edge

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Please install MetaMask or Rainbow Wallet!" error**
   - Install a compatible wallet extension
   - Refresh the page after installation

2. **Connection fails**
   - Check if wallet extension is unlocked
   - Ensure you're on a supported network
   - Try refreshing the page

3. **Balance not showing**
   - Check network connection
   - Verify wallet is connected to Ethereum mainnet
   - Wait a moment for balance to load

### Development Issues

1. **npm start fails**
   - Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
   - Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
   - Try `npm start` again
